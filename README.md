# Data-Augmentation
Comparing a transormer GAN and a LSTM GAN for augmenting timeseries datasets.

To use this code run the notbook files. The prototype notebooks contain the code for the training of data augmentation GANs. The validation model notebooks train the classification models for verifying the GANs. 

Requirements
python >= 3.8
